## The problem StonkR solves

StonkR is a stock market simulator for people who wish to try out investing without having the risk of losing their money. We use real-time stock data of USA stocks listed in NASDAQ and NYSE. Users are given $10,000 to start with and they can buy and sell shares of given stocks.
StonkR also has a SIP and a LumpSum calculator for people who wish to invest in Mutual Funds and check how much returns they could get for a rate of return and number of years. Prices are also adjusted for inflation.
This enables individuals, especially from the GenZ generation,  take interest in the Stock Market early and get an idea of it's functioning through the simulations.

## Challenges we ran into

- One of the main challenges we faced during our project was implementing authorisation. We found the documentation for Sawo Labs somewhat insufficient. For solving the issues, we talked to the mods on the discord server of Sawo labs
- Second biggest challenge was finding a free Stock Market API, we settled for IEXCloud with some limited credits per month.
- Setting up Supabase was difficult initially, but reading the docs and debugging finally made it possible!
